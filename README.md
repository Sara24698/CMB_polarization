# üåÄ CENN: CMB Extraction Neural Network

**CENN (CMB Extraction Neural Network)** is a deep learning framework designed to generate and clean **polarization maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**.  
It builds synthetic sky maps from theoretical power spectra and removes astrophysical contaminants through a fully connected neural network (FCNN) trained on multi-frequency data.

Through this software, the authors demonstrate that a neural‚Äënetwork‚Äëbased approach (similar in concept to our CENN) is capable of **recovering Q/U polarization sky maps** of the CMB from realistic multi‚Äëfrequency simulations (including foregrounds and noise). They show that:
- The mean absolute error for the E‚Äëmode and B‚Äëmode power spectra remains small (on the order of ¬µK¬≤) in ideal and realistic (Planck‚Äëlevel noise)
- The method can generalize to real observational data (i.e., the processed maps agree with established component‚Äêseparation outputs like those from the Planck mission) within ~5‚ÄØ% at intermediate and small angular scales.
- Although promising, the approach still faces limitations at large angular scales and in low signal‚Äêto‚Äênoise regimes; hence, further improvements (e.g., larger patches, more realistic noise modelling) are required for high‚Äëprecision cosmology.

Our pipeline ‚Äî generating maps with CAMB, adding contaminants, training CENN, and estimating spectra with NaMaster ‚Äî is grounded on state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart methodology and aligns with recent advances in CMB polarization analysis.

## üåå Overview

This software generates simulated maps of the CMB temperature and polarization fields ‚Äî **T, Q, U**, or their derived **E and B modes** ‚Äî from theoretical angular power spectra (**C‚Ñìs**) computed with [**CAMB**](https://camb.info/) (Lewis et al., 2000).

The workflow is composed of several key stages:

1. **CMB Map Generation**  
   Theoretical CMB power spectra obtained from CAMB are used to create full-sky maps in the HEALPix format for T, Q, and U components.

2. **Patch Extraction and Contamination**  
   The CMB maps are divided into smaller **sky patches**, to which various **foreground contaminants** are added:
   - Galactic **dust emission**  
   - **Synchrotron radiation**  
   - **Extragalactic point sources**  
   - **Instrumental white noise**

   Foreground templates are derived from **Planck Legacy Archive (PLA)** data, while white noise is generated synthetically.

3. **Multi-Frequency Data Preparation**  
   The contaminated patches are produced for several observing frequencies ‚Äî **100, 143, and 217 GHz** ‚Äî corresponding to the frequency range where instrumental noise is minimized.

4. **Neural Network Training (CENN)**  
   The fully connected neural network (**CENN**) is trained to **recover clean CMB patches at 143 GHz** from the contaminated multi-frequency inputs.  
   The network learns to disentangle CMB emission from astrophysical foregrounds and noise.

5. **Power Spectrum Estimation with NaMaster**  
   Once the clean patches are reconstructed, the **E- and B-mode angular power spectra** are computed using [**NaMaster**](https://namaster.readthedocs.io/) (Alonso et al., 2019).  
   These recovered spectra are then compared against:
   - Theoretical input spectra (labels from CAMB)
   - Residuals (`Output - Label`)
   - Analytical theoretical models

## üß† Purpose

## NaMaster Analysis of E/B Power Spectra

The estimation of the E- and B-mode power spectra from CMB maps is performed using **NaMaster** (`pymaster`), a Python library designed for pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimation in flat-sky and full-sky maps, including proper handling of masks and mode-coupling corrections. In this work, NaMaster is applied to both **simulated input maps** and **CENN-reconstructed output maps**.

### Purpose

The main goals of the NaMaster analysis are:

1. Compute the E- and B-mode power spectra from patches of the CMB polarization maps (Q and U).
2. Correct for the effects of partial sky coverage via mask apodization and decoupling.
3. Compare input (true) CMB spectra with the reconstructed output from the CENN network and quantify residuals.

### Inputs

The main inputs for the NaMaster analysis are:

- **Q and U maps**:
  - Input simulations: `data_Q[i]["sim"]` and `data_U[i]["sim"]`
  - CENN outputs: `data_Q[i]["net"]` and `data_U[i]["net"]`
- **Patch size**: 240√ó240 pixels after cutting 8 pixels from each edge (from original 256√ó256 patches).
- **Masking parameters**:
  - Flat-sky masks with apodization (apodization factor varies per resolution or patch type).
  - Holes in the mask for specific dust simulations.
- **Binning**: multipole bins defined via `NmtBinFlat`, e.g., `bins = np.arange(0, 2525, 35)`.

### Processing Steps

1. **Mask Creation**: Define a mask for each patch, apply apodization, and flatten for NaMaster.
2. **NaMaster Fields**: Create `NmtFieldFlat` objects for input, output, and residual maps, enabling pure-B mode estimation.
3. **Coupling Matrix**: Compute the mode-coupling matrix (`NmtWorkspaceFlat`) for each field.
4. **Pseudo-$C_\ell$ Computation**: Calculate coupled power spectra using `compute_coupled_cell_flat`.
5. **Decoupling**: Remove mode-coupling effects using `decouple_cell`.
6. **Averaging**: Combine spectra from all patches to obtain mean and standard deviation for EE, BB, and residual spectra.

### Outputs

The analysis produces:

- **Mean E-mode power spectrum** (`mean_ee`)
- **Mean B-mode power spectrum** (`mean_bb`)
- **Standard deviations** (`std_ee`, `std_bb`) representing uncertainties across patches.
- **Multipole values** (`ells_uncoupled`) corresponding to the binned spectra.

These results are later used for plotting and validation of the CENN network's reconstruction performance, comparing input, output, and residual power spectra.
